 * [2020/06/01] `paura_lite.py` added: a very simple command-line recorder and real-time visualization
 * [2020/01/02] python3 support added  

## General
 - ```paura.py``` is a Python tool for recording and analyzing sounds in an online 
and continuous manner. `paura` uses pySound (based on portaudio), so it can 
both be used in Linux and MacOs environments. 
 - `paura_lite.py` is a very simple command-line recorder and real-time visualization
  
## Installation
Before downloading this library and setting up the pip requirements, please 
consider the following:

### Requirements for Linux
 * Install [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/).
 * Install portaudio: `sudo apt-get install libasound-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0`
 * Install opencv for python: `sudo apt-get install python-opencv`
 * sudo apt-get install gnuplot (required only for `paura_lite.py`)

### Requirements for MacOs
 * Install [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/).
 * Install portaudio: `brew install portaudio`
 * Install pysound and opencv for python: `pip3 install pyaudio opencv-python`
 * brew install gnuplot (required only for `paura_lite.py`)

## Execution and outputs for `paura.py`

### Execution example
The following command records audio data using blocks of 1sec (segments). 

```
 python3 paura.py --blocksize 1.0 --spectrogram --chromagram --record_segments --record_all
```

### Output
For each segment, the script:
1) Visualizes the spectrogram, chromagram  along with the raw samples (waveform)
2) Applies a simple audio classifier that distinguishes between 4 classes namely
 silence, speech, music and other sounds.

### Output format

The predictions are printed in the console in the form of timestamp 
(segment starting point in seconds, counting from the recording starting time), 
class label (silence, music, speech or other), and prediction confidence, e.g.
```
...
12.71	other	0.52
13.63	speech	0.30
14.66	other	0.43
15.68	music	0.92
16.70	speech	0.30
...
```

Also, the waveform, spectrograms and chromagrams are visualized in dedicated 
plots. 

If the `--record_segments` flag is provided, 
each segment is saved in a folder named by the starting timestamp of the 
recording session, and has a filename indicated by its relative timestamp from 
the recording starting time, e.g. for the above example:
```
⇒ ls -1 2020_01_28_12:37AM_segments 
...
0012.71_other.wav
0013.63_speech.wav
0014.66_other.wav
0015.68_music.wav
0016.70_speech.wav
...
```

Finally, if `--record_all` is provided, the whole recording is saved in a 
singe audio file. Not to be used for very long recordings (many hours), due to 
memory issues. In the above example, the overall audio recording is stored in 
`2020_01_26_11:16PM.wav`

## Execution and outputs for `paura_lite.py`
This script takes no arguments and just records sounds, 
while visualizing each segment's spectrogram in the console.
```
python3 paura_lite.py
```
